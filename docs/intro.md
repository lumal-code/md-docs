# Introduction to Moondream

## Build with Moondream

Moondream is a tiny open-source vision AI that brings powerful image understanding to your applications and runs everywhere. Available in two optimized variants—Moondream 2B (3.9GB) for optimal performance and Moondream 0.5B (400MB) for resource-constrained environments—this compact model offers exceptional efficiency with faster inference times and lower computational requirements.

Interact with Moondream using simple, intuitive language without specialized machine learning expertise, making advanced vision AI accessible to developers of all backgrounds. As a vertically integrated model company, we deliver consistent visual understanding across our core capabilities while continuously evolving.

## Core Capabilities

## What is Moondream?

Moondream represents a new generation of multimodal AI that seamlessly combines visual perception with language understanding. At its core, Moondream integrates an advanced CLIP-based vision encoder that transforms images into rich feature representations. These visual features are then processed through a specialized projector that converts them into a format the language model can interpret and reason about.

The language model component has been meticulously optimized for visual understanding, enabling Moondream to perceive images with remarkable clarity and communicate about them using natural language. This architecture allows Moondream to process both text and images as unified inputs, perform sophisticated visual reasoning tasks, and generate detailed textual responses about visual content.

## Solutions

As a vertically integrated AI company, we regularly roll out new capabilities that extend beyond the core features. Our development roadmap continuously expands what Moondream can do:
